# AddressBookApp


#Your overall approach

1.    To start off, browsed through the Random User JSON structure to identify what data we need to display

2.    Retrieved the data and parsed the JSON result accordingly

3.    After this, thought about and came up with a basic UI, assuming basic requirements of a normal address book user

4.    Created all the views and its connections based on this UI

5.    Applied Autolayout on these views so that data could be accessed on most common iPhone models

6.    Added the Search functionality to enhance the usability and overall user experience

7.    Added the Call, SMS and Email functionality to make it more convenient for the user to interact with the address book

 
#What platform you chose and why you chose it?

The platform that I chose was iOS. The reason I chose iOS was because like and carry experience developing iOS apps.
 
 
#What features you completed?

1.    Data retrieval via web services

2.    JSON parsing

3.    Search functionality to search a contact by first/last name

4.    Call/SMS/Email functionality on the Contact’s Details page (call/SMS/email functionality does not work on simulators)

5.    Autolayout to support multiple iPhone models

 
#Given more time, what else would you have liked to complete and how long it would have taken you?

1.    Integrate Core Data to enable CRUD operations. This would also enhance the ability to use the app even when we do not have an internet connection (time needed: approx. 4 hours)

2.    Handle landscape mode, as well as develop Views for iPad (time needed: approx. 2 hours)

3.    Add gestures on the Contacts List for Call/SMS functionality to make the app more “cool” (time needed: approx. 1 hour)
